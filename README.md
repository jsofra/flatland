# flatland

flatland is a geometry library for Clojure.

flatland provides an abstract API for geometry operations and has a default implementation building on [clj-jts] (https://github.com/jsofra/clj-jts).

flatland allows for representation of geometry as Clojure data and a number of operations on that data.

The supported operations include Constructive Solid Geometry operations, spatial analysis and relation operations, unary constructive operations and measurement operations.


flatland provides similar functionality to [The Java Topology Suite] (http://www.vividsolutions.com/jts/main.htm) and the Python project [shapely] (http://gispython.org/shapely/manual.html).

## Usage

Much more documentaion and usage examples will come soon!
The construction of geometry is mostly the same as in [clj-jts] (https://github.com/jsofra/clj-jts) but using the eclij.core namespace.
